After project completion with the customer, new projects are often already in the pipeline and there is no time left to create an aAI internal project report. Nevertheless, a functionality for project summary generation and summary retrieval would open up possibilities for automated knowledge sharing and reusing of already existing knowledge for new projects. As an example, I am thinking of tech stacks and implementations (if possible) that could be re-used.
